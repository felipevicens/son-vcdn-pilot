## The forwarding graphs.
##

# Chain 1(user): user->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->vCC_in->vCC_in->cpoutput->server
# Chain 1(server): server->cpinput->vCC_in (L3)->vCC_in -> cpoutput -> user
# Chain 2(user): user->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->vTU_in (--> the file is created on the server on the mounted disk - NFS outside of the graph)
# Chain 2 (server) the same with Chain #1(server) 
# NOTE: vTC -> vCC and vTC -> vTU are L3, the decision and steering is performed at the vTC. In this view the actual vTC2vCC and vTC2vTU virtual links
# do not need to appear in the forwarding paths 
# this makes the chains simpler (testing will be required) 
# Chain 1(user) user->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->cpoutput (to server or to vTU)
# Chain 2(server) server->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->cpoutput 
# from the above it can be deducted that it can be a single chain that can be fixed for the whole service !
